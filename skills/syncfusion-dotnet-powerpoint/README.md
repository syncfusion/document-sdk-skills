# Syncfusion .NET Powerpoint Library Skill

## Overview

Create, edit and convert PowerPoint (.pptx) files using the Syncfusion Presentation Library.
This skill supports two operational modes — generating C# code for the user’s project or executing tasks directly through a CSX script.

See **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)** for the full intent-routing guide and rules.

## Getting Started

### How to Integrate Skills

**Step 1: Checkout and copy the required skills**

Clone or download the Document-SDK-Skills repository and copy the **syncfusion-dotnet-powerpoint** skill from the `skills/` directory.

**Step 2: Install the skills**

Place the copied skill folders in your workspace following this structure:

```
your-workspace/
├── .github/skills/          # or .claude/skills/ or .codestudio/skills/
│   └── syncfusion-dotnet-powerpoint/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── your-project-files...
└── Program.cs
```

**Step 3: Verify and manage your skills**

Type `/skills` in the GitHub Copilot or Code Studio chat to quickly access the Configure Skills menu and manage your installed skills.

**Step 4: Use skills in VS Code**

There are two ways to use skills:

1. **Slash commands** - Type `/` in the GitHub Copilot chat to see available skills. For example:
   ```
   /syncfusion-dotnet-powerpoint Create a presentation with animation
   ```

2. **Automatic loading** - Simply describe your task naturally, and your AI Agent automatically loads the relevant skill:
   ```
   Create a powerpoint presentation with company letterhead and a data table
   ```

When a skill is loaded, AI Agent gains specialized knowledge of Syncfusion .NET libraries and can help you generate code or execute document operations efficiently.

## Example Prompts
#### Mode 1 — Code Generation
*Use these when you want C# code snippets for your own project.* 

- "Show me Presentation code to create a PPTX with a title slide, a content slide, and a bullet list."
- "Generate a C# snippet to add a 3×4 table to a PowerPoint slide using Syncfusion Presentation."
- "Write Program.cs code using Syncfusion Presentation to add a chart to a slide."
- "How do I add slide numbers and a footer to a presentation using Syncfusion Presentation?"

#### Mode 2 — Presentation Generation
*Use these when you want a .pptx file created right now in the workspace.*

- "Create a presentation about the top 5 programming languages in 2025."
- "Generate a meeting agenda presentation and save it to output/agenda.pptx."
- "Open output/report.pptx and change its theme to the Office theme."
- "Convert output/report.pptx to PDF."
