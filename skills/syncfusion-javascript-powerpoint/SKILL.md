# Processing PowerPoint Presentations

A comprehensive skill for creating, reading, and manipulating PowerPoint presentations programmatically using the Syncfusion JavaScript PowerPoint library. This library provides seamless integration for TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue, and Node.js applications.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user needs to:

- **Create PowerPoint presentations** from scratch with slides, text boxes, paragraphs, and formatted text
- **Open existing presentations** from `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, Base64 strings, or file paths
- **Modify presentations** by accessing existing slides and adding or updating shapes
- **Save presentations** to file system downloads (browser) or disk (Node.js)
- **Get raw bytes** of a saved presentation as a `Uint8Array` for upload or in-memory use
- **Format text** using font name, size, bold, and alignment options
- **Integrate PowerPoint generation** into React, Angular, Vue, or Node.js applications

**Platform Support:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue, Node.js

## Library Overview

The Syncfusion JavaScript PowerPoint library (`@syncfusion/ej2-pptx`) is a lightweight, high-performance non-UI library written natively in JavaScript for:

- Creating PowerPoint presentations from scratch
- Opening, modifying, and saving existing `.pptx` presentations
- Adding and formatting slides, text boxes, paragraphs, and text runs
- Running in both **browser** and **Node.js** environments
- No dependency on Microsoft Office or COM libraries

**Supported File Format:** `.PPTX` (Office Open XML) only

**Key Classes and Enums:**

| Class / Enum | Description |
|---|---|
| `Presentation` | Main entry point — `create()` or `open()` presentations |
| `ISlide` | Represents a slide in the presentation |
| `IShape` / `ITextBox` | Shape elements placed on a slide |
| `ITextBody` | Text container within a shape |
| `IParagraph` | A paragraph within a text body |
| `ITextPart` | A run of text with specific formatting |
| `HorizontalAlignmentType` | Enum for paragraph alignment (`Left`, `Center`, `Right`, `Justify`) |

## Documentation and Navigation Guide

### Getting Started

📄 **Read:** [references/getting-started.md](references/getting-started.md)

Use this reference when the user needs to:
- Install the `@syncfusion/ej2-pptx` npm package
- Set up the library for React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, Vue, or Node.js
- Understand prerequisites and environment requirements
- Create their first PowerPoint presentation from scratch
- Learn about the basic presentation creation workflow
- Understand key classes and common import patterns
- Avoid common errors such as `ReferenceError: ej is not defined`

### Loading and Saving Presentations

📄 **Read:** [references/loading-and-saving.md](references/loading-and-saving.md)

Use this reference when the user needs to:
- Open an existing `.pptx` file from a `Uint8Array` or `ArrayBuffer`
- Open a presentation from a browser file input (`<input type="file">`)
- Open a presentation from disk in Node.js using `fs.readFileSync`
- Fetch a remote presentation from a URL using `fetch`
- Save a presentation as a file download in the browser
- Save a presentation to disk in Node.js
- Obtain the raw `Uint8Array` bytes of a saved presentation
- Perform a full open → modify → save round-trip workflow
- Understand supported input formats and their limitations

## General Rules and Best Practices

1. **Always use named imports** from the npm package:
   ```typescript
   import { Presentation, HorizontalAlignmentType } from '@syncfusion/ej2-pptx';
   ```
   The npm package does **not** expose a global `ej` namespace. Using `ej.pptx.Presentation` without loading the UMD bundle from CDN will throw `ReferenceError: ej is not defined`.

2. **Always `await` async methods:**
   - `await Presentation.open(data)` — opens an existing presentation
   - `await pptxDoc.save()` — saves the presentation

3. **Supported format:** Only `.pptx` (Office Open XML) is supported. Legacy `.ppt` binary format is not supported.

4. **Browser vs. Node.js behavior:**
   - In browsers, `save()` triggers a file download automatically.
   - In Node.js, `save()` return the saved pptx bytes.

5. **Slide access is 0-based:** Use `pptxDoc.slides(0)` to access the first slide.
